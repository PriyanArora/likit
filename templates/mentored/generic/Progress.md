**Current Gate:** G0 (Project Setup)
**Current Phase:** —
**Project Category:** [web / systems / creative — set by G0.3]
**Last Updated:** [DATE]
**Session Notes:** [status]

> Each gate (G) corresponds to a phase (P): G1 = P1, G2 = P2, etc.
> ALL checkboxes must be `[x]` with proof shown to pass a gate.
