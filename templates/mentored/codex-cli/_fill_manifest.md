phase_1_name: Repo Setup
phase_1_goal: Clean repo, .gitignore, folder structure, deps installed

  - .gitignore covers secrets, deps, build artifacts
  - Folder structure matches ProjectSummary
  - Config/env example file with all keys
  - Dependencies install cleanly
phase_1_proof: Show `git log --oneline -1`. Show .gitignore contents.
phase_1_commit: chore(init): initialise project structure
