# Likit

Lightweight, gate-driven AI dev workflow kit. One install, works with the major AI coding tools.

Likit gives your AI assistant a disciplined way to build software: one small, provable step at a time, with checkpoints it is not allowed to skip. It installs a few Markdown files into your project plus a tiny command-line tool that keeps everyone honest. It stays entirely local to your repo. It is not a framework, a hosted product, or a heavyweight methodology.

## What it is (in plain terms)

Picture building a house with an inspector who won't let you start the walls until the foundation passes inspection. Likit is that inspector for software.

- Your project is split into **phases** (foundation, plumbing, wiring, and so on).
- Each phase ends at a **gate**. A gate has a checklist and a **proof**, something you actually run or show to prove the phase works.
- The AI may only work on the **current** gate. It cannot jump ahead, and it cannot mark a gate done on your word alone. The proof has to be real.

The whole idea: small steps, real proof, no skipping.

## Install

```bash
npm i likit
```

On install Likit prints a banner and, in an interactive terminal, starts the setup wizard. In a non-interactive environment (like CI) run setup yourself:

```bash
npx likit init
```

Requires Node.js. Current version: **2.0.0**.

## How you use it, start to finish

1. **Install.** `npm i likit`. The banner prints; the wizard runs if your terminal is interactive.
2. **Set up.** `npx likit init`. The wizard asks four questions (mode, AI tool, project type, solo or team), then writes the right files for your tool. It also adds `.env` to your `.gitignore` so secrets are not committed by accident.
3. **Describe your project.** Right after the wizard, Likit asks you to paste or describe your full project spec and saves it to `prompt.md` at the repo root.
4. **Build the plan.** `npx likit start` (or `/likit-start` in tools with slash commands). Likit reads `prompt.md` and fills `ProjectSummary.md`, `BuildFlow.md`, and `Progress.md` from that spec.
5. **Work the gates.** The AI reads its entry file (for example `CLAUDE.md`), finds the current gate in `Progress.md`, and works one gate at a time. Each gate is a short list of verifiable steps ending in a proof. When every box is proven, the AI auto-commits the phase and advances.

## Modes

You pick one during setup.

| Mode | Who writes the code | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Mentored** | You | Learning and practice. The AI acts as a senior mentor: it questions, reviews, and refuses to write your implementation code, making you prove you understand each step. |
| **Vibe** | The AI | Faster shipping. The AI implements; you own the architecture and review. Each gate needs implementation, passing tests, and your explicit approval. |

## Platforms

Likit adapts its files to whichever AI tool you choose at install time.

| Tool | Main file it writes |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` plus `.claude/commands/*` slash commands plus workflow files |
| **OpenAI Codex CLI** | `AGENTS.md` plus workflow files |
| **Claude.ai / Pro** | `LIKIT_CONTEXT.md` and `LIKIT_PROJECTS_PROMPT.md` |
| **ChatGPT** | `LIKIT_GPT.md` |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/rules/likit.mdc` plus workflow files |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurfrules` plus workflow files |
| **Other** | `LIKIT_PROMPT.md`, a single paste-ready prompt |

Every tool also gets `.likit/config.json` (your Likit settings) and `.likit/HOW_TO_USE.md` (a quick reference for the chosen tool). Project types are `web`, `systems`, and `creative`; they change which `ProjectSummary` template you start from.

## The files Likit creates

These live in your repo and are the spec the AI follows. The exact set varies by tool; this is the Claude Code / Codex layout.

| File | What it is for |
|---|---|
| **Entry file** (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, rules file, or pasted prompt) | The AI's instructions: session startup, the gate-pass rules, and the command list. |
| **`guide.md`** | The enforcement rules: the 13 Habits and the Red Lines (see The laws). |
| **`ProjectSummary.md`** | Your project's architecture and constraints, filled during setup. |
| **`BuildFlow.md`** | The phases (P1 to P17), each with its checklist and **Proof** line. |
| **`Progress.md`** | The live tracker: the current gate and which boxes are checked. |
| **`G0_questionnaire.md`** | The setup interview used to fill everything above. |
| **`_fill_manifest.md`** | The worksheet the AI fills to turn your answers into the files. |
| **`prompt.md`** | Your raw project description, captured by the wizard. |
| **`.likit/config.json`** | Mode, tool, project type, solo/team, username. |
| **`.likit/HOW_TO_USE.md`** | A tool-specific cheat sheet. |

## The gate system

Gates run from **G0** to **G17**. Each build gate `G<n>` corresponds to phase `P<n>` in `BuildFlow.md` (G1 = P1, G2 = P2, and so on). Every checkbox must be `[x]` with proof shown before a gate passes.

**G0, Project Setup.** Before any code, Likit interviews you to lock down identity, developer profile, architecture, features, constraints, and red lines. Mentored mode has 6 sub-gates (G0.1 to G0.6); Vibe mode has 3 (G0.1 to G0.3). G0 ends by generating your filled `ProjectSummary.md`, `BuildFlow.md`, and `Progress.md`, with zero leftover placeholders.

**G1 to G17, Build gates.** A typical path: repo setup, data layer, core entry point, core logic plus tests, feature work, auth, integrations, performance, deploy, CI/CD. Each phase's goal and proof are tailored to your project during G0.

**Advancing a gate (the ritual):**
1. Every checkbox for the gate is `[x]`, and tests pass on test-bearing phases.
2. Gate ledger: the AI re-reads `Progress.md` and `BuildFlow.md`, confirms the phase's **Proof** line is filled, and runs `npx likit doctor`, which must pass.
3. The AI auto-commits the phase with a `chore(likit): complete phase <N>` message.
4. Only after the commit succeeds does it announce the pass and move to the next gate.

If any step fails, the AI stays in the gate and fixes it.

## The laws

The workflow files hold Likit to a fixed set of engineering standards, enforced on every code-related response.

**The 13 Habits** (in `guide.md`): walking skeleton first, vertical slices, conventional commits, test-first on core logic, clean names, YAGNI/KISS/DRY, refactor in a separate commit, secrets never in the repo, structured logging, test every seam, and more.

**Red Lines**, hard blockers that stop a gate immediately: no implementation code written for the student (Mentored mode), no `catch`/`except` without cause chaining, no vague names, no vague commits, no committing features to `main`, and no hardcoded secrets. A secret means a real credential value written as a literal in tracked code (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys). Environment variables and placeholders are fine.

## Enforcement: `npx likit doctor`

The workflow files instruct the AI to obey the gate system and the laws, but instructions can drift over a long session. `likit doctor` makes the core laws checkable instead of trusted. It runs two groups of checks.

**Setup checks:** your `.likit/config.json` is complete, the entry file and `guide.md` exist, `BuildFlow.md` is filled (no leftover placeholders), `Progress.md` and `ProjectSummary.md` exist, no unused `ProjectSummary_*` templates remain, and (in team mode) each developer has a progress file.

**Law checks:**
- **Gate integrity:** no gate is marked passed while an earlier gate still has unchecked boxes. Catches jumping ahead.
- **Commit convention:** the last 20 commit subjects match the conventional-commit format (`type(scope): description`, under 72 chars).
- **No hardcoded secrets:** a scan of tracked files for obvious credential leaks (AWS keys, private-key headers, quoted `password`/`api_key`/`token` values), skipping environment references and placeholders.

`doctor` exits non-zero if any check fails, so you can wire it into a git hook or CI. The gate-advance ritual already runs it before committing each phase.

> The secret scan is intentionally simple; it catches careless leaks, not a determined one. For thorough coverage add a dedicated tool like gitleaks.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npx likit init` | Run the setup wizard |
| `npx likit init --dry-run` | Show the files that would be written, without writing them |
| `npx likit start` | Populate planning files from `prompt.md` |
| `npx likit sync` | Update Likit's own template files (not your content) |
| `npx likit doctor` | Validate setup and enforce the laws (exits non-zero on failure) |
| `npx likit migrate` | Migrate an old `likit-claude` or `likit-codex` setup |
| `npx likit session-bundle` | Regenerate paste-ready context for chat tools |
| `npx likit export-template` | Export your G0 output to `project.likit.json` |
| `npx likit import-template <file>` | Reuse a saved project template |
| `npx likit team-status` | Show per-developer progress in team mode |
| `npx likit version` | Print version and current config |
| `npx likit help` | Show command help |

`init` also takes flags for scripted setup: `--mode <mentored|vibe>`, `--tool <claude-code|codex-cli|claude-chat|chatgpt|cursor|windsurf|generic>`, `--type <web|systems|creative>`, `--solo`/`--team` (with `--username <name>`), `--force` to overwrite existing Likit files, and `--quick` to skip the Vibe-mode architecture critique.

## Slash commands (Claude Code)

In Claude Code, Likit installs these under `.claude/commands/` for both modes:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/likit-start` | Populate planning files from `prompt.md` |
| `/likit-help` | List Likit commands and the current gate |
| `/phase-status` | Show the current gate and phase |
| `/phase-check` | Quick where-am-I, what's-next |
| `/phase-explain` | Explain the current phase and what comes next |
| `/step-explain` | Break the current step into smaller actions |
| `/mode-status` | Show whether you are in Mentored or Vibe mode |
| `/gate-review` | Audit the current gate (architecture cross-check and the gate ledger) before advancing |
| `/gate-rollback` | Roll back to a previous gate |
| `/progress-log` | Full progress report |
| `/progress-save` | Persist progress to `Progress.md` |
| `/session-bundle` | Regenerate paste-ready chat context |
| `/export-template` | Export G0 output to a reusable template |

Codex and other terminal tools have no slash commands; you ask in plain language, for example "show phase status".

## Team mode

Team mode commits the shared setup files while keeping per-developer progress in `.likit/Progress_<username>.md`. Each developer runs `npx likit init` once after cloning, and `npx likit team-status` shows everyone's progress.

## Template sharing

After G0 completes, export your architecture and BuildFlow with `npx likit export-template` (writes `project.likit.json`). Reuse it on a similar project with `npx likit import-template project.likit.json`.

## Token budgets

Likit stays lean so it does not crowd out your project in the AI's context. CLI workflow files target under 3,000 tokens in Mentored mode and under 2,500 in Vibe mode. Chat bundles target under 4,500 tokens; single-file generic prompts under 5,000.

## Repo layout (for contributors)

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `bin/likit.js` | CLI entry point, routes commands |
| `src/*.js` | CLI implementation (`wizard`, `generator`, `doctor`, `start`, `sync`, `bundle`, `migrate`, `template`, `banner`) |
| `templates/<mentored|vibe>/<tool>/` | The Markdown workflow files, per mode and tool |
| `.likit/` | Created inside a user's project at init (config plus guide) |
| `test/smoke.js` | `npm test`: CLI checks, a full mode x tool x type generation sweep, and the `doctor` law checks |
